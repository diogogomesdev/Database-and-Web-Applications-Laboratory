# EAP: Architecture Specification and Prototype

> ManageME project is an Web Application for managing college projects. This is a tool that can be very useful to all college students who have to carry out complex group projects in which each member is responsible for certain tasks. We believe that this application is of great benefit to all university students especially in the current times we are living due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## A7: High-level architecture. Privileges. Web resources specification
